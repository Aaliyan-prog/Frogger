# Frogger Game - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Frogger** arcade game using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game brings the nostalgic experience of guiding a frog across busy roads and rivers to reach its home while avoiding obstacles.

## Features:
- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate the frog across a road filled with moving cars and trucks, and then through a river with floating logs and turtles.
- **Responsive Controls**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the frog's movement.
- **Levels & Difficulty**: The game increases in difficulty as you progress, with faster-moving cars and more challenging river sections.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the score as you successfully guide the frog to safety. Each successful crossing adds points.
- **Game Over & Restart**: When the frog collides with an obstacle, the game ends, and you can restart the game.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the game (HTML5 canvas for rendering the game field).
- **CSS**: For styling the game interface and positioning elements on the screen.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic, including movement, collision detection, scoring, and game state management.
